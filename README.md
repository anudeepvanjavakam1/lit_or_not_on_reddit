## Demo App

[![Streamlit App](<https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg>)](<https://anudeepvanjavakam1-lit-or-not-on-reddit-app-krji2w.streamlit.app/>)

## Project Overview

This app searches reddit posts and comments across many subreddits to determine if it has a positive or negative sentiment based on sentiment intensity analyzer (VADER).
Text in both original posts and comments is analyzed. If the results did not give you enough information, try phrasing the search term differently and be more specific.
Feel free to increase no. of posts and no. of comments to get more breadth and depth about what redditors think😉

## Problem Statement

We can all agree researching products, platforms or services is painful and time taking.

I often find myself researching multiple sources across numerous chrome tabs to see if something is reliable, worthy, and reasonable to buy and still feel like I am lost. Information is scattered, hard to find, and hard to sort through (multiple mentions of different products, mixed reviews) and get a clear summary.

More over, Misleading ads, SEO spam (best 5 products articles with least research), and fake reviews (Affliated links, sponsored content) can make the whole experience frustrating.

Reddit is one place where people leave honest reviews and discourage any fake ones.
With over 52 million daily active users, Reddit provides a platform for people from all walks of life to share their experiences and opinions.

This app takes in user's input and searches posts (sorted by relevancy) and comments across subreddits to analyze sentiment. 
## Features

User choices:
- No. of reddit posts to scrape: More posts take longer time for results. Ex: "10" gets 10 most relevant posts for the  search term. If the no. of posts scraped reaches this limit, then no more comments are scraped regardless of your choice for no. of comments
- No. of comments to scrape: More comments take longer time for results. If the no. of comments scraped reaches this limit, then no more posts are scraped regardless of your choice for no. of posts
- No. of top comments to display: App displays Top comments and their upvotes at the bottom of the page. Comments are sorted by 'best' on reddit.
- Search term (ex: is xxx product worth it? is __ subscription worth it? product/platform/service reviews)

After clicking the button 'Click me to find out if its Lit' button, app displays the following:
- Percentage of positive or negative sentiment depending on whether the overall percentage of positive words is greater than or less than that of negative words
- No. of posts scraped
- No. of comments scraped
- No. of tokens analyzed
- A bar graph of commonly used positive words and their counts
- A bar graph of commonly used negative words and their counts
- A bar graph of percentage of positive and negative words
- A word cloud showing positive (green), negative (red) and neutral (grey) words
- Top 5 comments (sorted by 'best' on reddit) and their upvotes

Text in both original posts and comments is analyzed. If the results did not give you enough information, try phrasing the search term differently and be more specific. Feel free to increase no. of posts and no. of comments to get more breadth and depth about what redditors think😉
