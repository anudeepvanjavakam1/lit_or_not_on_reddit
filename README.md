# LIT or NOT on REDDIT

Many people add "Reddit" to their search queries to find authentic product reviews/feedback and thats why Reddit is the source for this app.

Looking to buy something💰, but not sure if it's dope?👀
Let my app be your guide💪, it's the ultimate Reddit scope!🔎

No need to waste your money💲, on something that's not legit👎,
Just use this app to know if it's worth it👌

Made with love on streamlit❤,
To help you find if it's LIT or NOT on REDDIT!🔥


This app searches reddit posts and comments across many subreddits to determine if it has a positive or negative sentiment based on sentiment intensity analyzer (VADER).
Text in both original posts and comments is analyzed. If the results did not give you enough information, try phrasing the search term differently and be more specific.
Feel free to increase no. of posts and no. of comments to get more breadth and depth about what redditors think😉
