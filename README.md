Made with love on streamlit,
To help you find if it's LIT or NOT on REDDIT!


This app helps users find if a product/service/platform is lit or not on reddit. People can search if something is worth buying or for reviews. This app searches reddit posts and comments across many subreddits to determine if it is approved by redditors and has positive or negative sentiment based on sentiment intensity analyzer (VADER).
